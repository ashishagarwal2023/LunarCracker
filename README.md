# LCCracker
> A simple Lunar Client cracker that I made, it depends on NodeJS.

It works, yes it works! On all lunar client versions. If you recieve "Invalid session" with your username after using this tool, you've cracked Lunar Client and can freely go multi or single player now! For all mc versions with lunar client!

## Usage
`./lccracker.exe crack <username>` and restart Lunar Client (and minecraft).
> This works by overwritting the accounts.json with a invalid file but specifying a username, making it fail to login as premium but we get cracked.

> _New:_ As of 1.1.0, it will automatically crash and re-launch Lunar Client upon cracking.

## Downloading
Just download from releases. Or if you do not trust, you can compile the source yourself. I made it a exe so peoples who don't want to install NodeJS can also work.

## Compiling yourslf
Install `pkg`, and `pkg lccracker.js -t node18-win` & you get the exe file.

## Legal
I do not promote cracking things, this project is just for educational purposes. I'm learning NodeJS yet and so I made this simple project I liked to.
