# LCCracker
> A simple Lunar Client cracker that I made, it depends on NodeJS.

## Usage
`./lccracker.exe crack <username>` and restart Lunar Client (and minecraft).
> This works by overwritting the accounts.json with a invalid file but specifying a username, making it fail to login as premium but we get cracked.

## Downloading
Just download from releases. Or if you do not trust, you can compile the source yourself. I made it a exe so peoples who don't want to install NodeJS can also work.

## Compiling yourslf
Install `pkg`, and `pkg lccracker.js -t node18-win` & you get the exe file.
